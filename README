# Simple thesis defense template

This repository is a simple template for a Latex thesis defense poster
at the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, Charles University.
The `poster.tex` contains the poster content.
At the beginning of the file, several macros provide basic customization of the header contents
and basic formatting of the poster boxes.
Below that are some useful macros for simple content boxes.
Their usage is showcased in the example content of the file.

It is recommended to build with `pdflatex` --- I tried with `luatex` but was unable to figure out czech characters...

The header formatting was taken and modified from the [Overleaf CERN poster template](https://cs.overleaf.com/latex/templates/cern-poster-template/qqbtjhjhfgpz).
The logos of the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, Charles University and the university itself
were taken from the [simple-poster template](https://github.com/mff-cuni-cz/simple-poster).
